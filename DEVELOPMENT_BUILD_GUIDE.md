# Development Build Setup Guide

## 🎉 Build Status: COMPLETED!

Both iOS and Android development builds have been successfully created and installed!

## ✅ What's Been Completed

✅ **iOS Development Build**: Successfully built and installed on iOS Simulator
✅ **Android Development Build**: Successfully built and installed on Android Emulator  
✅ **EAS CLI**: Updated to latest version (16.20.0)
✅ **Build Tools**: Fastlane and CocoaPods installed
✅ **Configuration**: Fixed dependency conflicts and metro config issues
✅ **Installation Scripts**: Created for easy future builds

## 🚀 How to Start Development

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start Metro bundler and show you a QR code and local URL.

### 2. Open Your Development Build

**For iOS Simulator:**

- The app is already installed and should be visible in your iOS Simulator
- Open the "pursuit" app from the simulator home screen
- It will automatically connect to your development server

**For Android Emulator:**

- The app is already installed on your Android emulator
- Open the "pursuit" app from the emulator
- It will automatically connect to your development server

### 3. Development Workflow

Once connected, you can:

- Edit your code and see changes instantly with Fast Refresh
- Use React Developer Tools
- Access device features (camera, GPS, etc.)
- Debug with Flipper or React Native Debugger

## 🔄 Creating New Development Builds

### Quick Build Commands

```bash
# Build for iOS simulator
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Build for Android emulator/device
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Build for both platforms
eas build --profile development --platform all
```

### Using the Installation Script

We've created a convenient script for future builds:

```bash
./scripts/install-dev-builds.sh
```

This script will:

- Check prerequisites
- Guide you through platform selection
- Build and install automatically
- Provide next steps

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No development build found" error:**

- Make sure you've installed the development build first
- Verify the bundle identifier matches your app config
- Try rebuilding: `eas build --profile development --platform [ios/android]`

**Metro bundler connection issues:**

- Ensure your device/simulator is on the same network
- Try restarting Metro: `yarn dev`
- Clear Metro cache: `yarn start --reset-cache`

**Build failures:**

- Check the build logs on expo.dev
- Verify all dependencies are compatible
- Run `npx expo install --check` to fix version conflicts

## 📱 Platform-Specific Notes

### iOS Simulator

- Build includes `"simulator": true` in eas.json
- No Apple Developer account required for simulator builds
- Uses development provisioning automatically

### Android Emulator

- Uses development keystore generated by EAS
- Supports both emulator and physical devices
- Debug builds include additional debugging tools

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production

When ready for production builds:

1. Update `eas.json` production profile
2. Configure app signing (iOS: App Store Connect, Android: Play Console)
3. Build: `eas build --profile production --platform all`
4. Submit: `eas submit --profile production --platform all`

The app should now appear on your iOS Simulator home screen with the name "pursuit". Tap it to open.

## Alternative Approaches

### If the local build fails:

#### Option 1: Cloud build (recommended)

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

This builds in the cloud and doesn't require Apple Developer credentials for simulator builds.

#### Option 2: Use Expo prebuild approach

```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
npx expo run:ios
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues:

1. **Build fails due to dependencies**: Run `npx expo install --check` to fix version mismatches
2. **Simulator not found**: Make sure iOS Simulator is open before installing
3. **App doesn't connect**: Make sure both the development server and app are running

### Dependencies to fix (as noted by expo doctor):

- Remove `package-lock.json` (you're using yarn)
- Update `expo-auth-session` to `~6.0.3`
- Update `expo-crypto` to `~14.0.2`
- Add `.expo/` to `.gitignore`

You can fix these later with:

```bash
rm package-lock.json
npx expo install --check
echo ".expo/" >> .gitignore
```

## What makes this different from Expo Go?

- ✅ Full access to native modules
- ✅ Custom native code
- ✅ All libraries work (including those not supported by Expo Go)
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Production-like environment

## Need help?

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the build logs for specific errors
2. Try the alternative approaches above
3. Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Expo SDK 52
